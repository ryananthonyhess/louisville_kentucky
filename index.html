        As anyone who comes here soon discovers, Louisville is one of the most uniquely authentic destinations on the planet. Welcome to Bourbon City.</p>
      <p class="intro">Yes, Bourbon is a spirit that comes in a glass, but it’s also a spirit that defines our culture and compassion, our arts and parks, our creative energy. It’s this same spirit that continued and created Louisville itself -  a city that combines heritage with innovation, authenticity with originality, quirkiness with friendliness in a way that’s completely unique to our region.
